	Design a UI like this:


			[_______A_____] <--- this is a textview
			[_______B_____] <--- this is another textview
			[______A+B____] <--- this is a read only textview
				[Add] <--- this is a button


	The user can now enter a numbers in the first and second boxes
	When the user clicks the "add" button, you will calculate the sum of numbers
	in the first two boxes and display it in the third one.

* Take care of conversions.			
* In order to use the views on the screen use findViewById
