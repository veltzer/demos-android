Show a TextView on the screen.
Read number from that text view.
Have an "execute" button which launched an AsyncTask
	which calculates the sum of squares up to that number.
When the async finishes, show the result in a different
	read only, text view.
the "execute" button should be disabled until the AsyncTask
	finishes.

page 188 in your material shows the use of AsyncTask.

More advanced exercise: report with progress
- add a progress bar to the GUI.
- add a onProgressUpdate method to AsyncTask.
- call 'publishProgress' in your computation.
- see that the progress bar updates nicely.
