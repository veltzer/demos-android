# Intent and activities

* Create an app with two activities.

* Each activity will have a button
    Activity 1 will have a button with the text "Go to activity 2" on it
    Activity 2 will have a button with the text "Go to activity 1" on it

* pressing the button will switch activities (Use Intents).

* advanced
    Add an EditText box next to each button.
    When pressing the "Go to activity 2" button activity 2 will be activated
    and show the string from activity 1.
    This means you will need to pass the string in activity 1 as extra data with the Intent.
    At activity 2 you will need to get the data and fill in the EditBox.
    Same for Activity 2.
