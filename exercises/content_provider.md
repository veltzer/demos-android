# Content provider exercise

- first add some contacts (dummy ones) in your emulator.

- show list view of all contacts you have on the phone.
    - you will need an adapter.
    - use ListView (or ListActivity)
    - you will need permission in your manifest.
    - add a button which refreshes the display.

Advanced:
- create your own content provider.
    - declare it in your manifest.
    - use it instead of the google contacts provider.
