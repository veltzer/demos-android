Add an activity.
Look at the code that was added to your project
    XML file
    Java file
    Changes in the manifest file

Run the application, see your activity.

Add stuff to the xml (for example a button)

See that you can see it when you run.

Add another activity with different content.

Switch the intent filter in the manifest file to your second activity
